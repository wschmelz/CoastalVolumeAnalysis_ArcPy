abstract = {Temporal and spatial changes in wind speed, wind direction, and moisture content are ubiquitous across sandy coastal beaches. Often these factors interact in unknown ways to create complexity that confounds our ability to model sediment transport at any point across the beach as well as our capacity to predict sediment delivery into the adjacent foredunes. This study was designed to measure wind flow and sediment transport over a beach and foredune at Greenwich Dunes, Prince Edward Island National Park, with the express purpose of addressing these complex interactions. Detailed measurements are reported for one stormy day, October 11, 2004, during which meteorological conditions were highly variable. Wind speed ranged from 4 ms−1 to over 20 ms−1, wind direction was highly oblique varying between 60° and 85° from shore perpendicular, and moisture content of the sand surface ranged from a minimum of about 3% (by mass) to complete saturation depending on precipitation, tidal excursion, and storm surge that progressively inundated the beach. The data indicate that short-term variations (i.e., minutes to hours) in sediment transport across this beach arise predominantly because of short-term changes in wind speed, as is expected, but also because of variations in wind direction, precipitation intensity, and tide level. Even slight increases in wind speed are capable of driving more intense saltation events, but this relationship is mediated by other factors on this characteristically narrow beach. As the angle of wind approach becomes more oblique, the fetch distance increases and allows greater opportunity for the saltation system to evolve toward an equilibrium transport state before reaching the foredunes. Whether the theoretically-predicted maximum rate of transport is ever achieved depends on the character of the sand surface (e.g., grain size, slope, roughness, vegetation, moisture content) and on various attributes of the wind field (e.g., average wind speed, unsteadiness, approach angle, flow compression, boundary layer development). Moisture content is widely acknowledged as an important factor in controlling release of sediment from the beach surface. All other things being equal, the rate of sediment transport over a wet surface is lesser than over a dry surface. On this beach, the moisture effect has two important influences: (a) in a temporal sense, the rate of sediment transport typically decreases in association with rainfall and increases when surface drying takes place; and (b) in a spatio-temporal sense, shoreline excursions associated with nearshore processes (such as wave run-up, storm surge, and tidal excursions) have the effect of constraining the fetch geometry of the beach—i.e., narrowing the width of the beach. Because saturated sand surfaces, such as found in the swash zone, will only reluctantly yield sediments to aeolian entrainment, the available beach surface across which aeolian transport can occur becomes narrower as the sea progressively inundates the beach. Under these constrained conditions, the transport system begins to shut down unless wind angle becomes highly oblique (thereby increasing fetch distance). In this study, maximum sediment transport was usually measured on the mid-beach rather than the upper beach (i.e., closer to the foredunes). This unusual finding is likely because of internal boundary layer development across the beach, which yields a decrease in near-surface wind speed (and hence, transport capacity) in the landward direction. Although widely recognized in the fluid mechanics literature, this decrease in near-surface shear stress as a by-product of a developing boundary layer in the downwind direction has not been adequately investigated in the context of coastal aeolian geomorphology.}

They provide a simplified form to communicate complex data and information, and constitute a facilitator mechanism in the dialog among stakeholders. In this work, a review on the use of geoindicators in sandy coastal environments is performed. It was found that, despite the obvious advantages in reporting the state of the coast using geoindicators, their generalized adoption seems to be stalled and is limited to a few management settings and particular projects. The existence of a myriad of coastal geoindicators, that frequently are poorly defined, is identified as the major difficulty in their widespread use. The present work aims to contribute towards the establishment of a common framework for coastal geoindicators, focusing on sandy coastal environments. The main objective of the compilation and definition of the indicators herein presented is to simplify and clarify their designations, and objectively present the measurement and reporting criteria aiming at a consensus-based approach. Sixteen coastal geoindicators are identified as relevant for the description of the state of beach, coastal dunes, and coastal barrier environments. This effort contributes to the adoption of coastal geoindicators as an effective communication tool leading to a more standardized report on the state of the coastal zone.}

Rising sea level not only inundates low-lying coastal regions but also contributes to the redistribution of sediment along sandy coasts. Over the long term, sea-level rise (SLR) causes barrier islands to migrate landward while conserving mass through offshore and onshore sediment transport. Under these conditions, coastal systems adjust to SLR dynamically while maintaining a characteristic geometry that is unique to a particular coast. Coastal marshes are susceptible to accelerated SLR because their vertical accretion rates are limited and they may drown. As marshes convert to open water, tidal exchange through inlets increases, which leads to sand sequestration in tidal deltas and erosion of adjacent barrier shorelines.",

The gliders are equipped with a conductivity-temperature-depth sensor, and some carry optical ECO-sensor pucks. The physical-optical data are used to examine storm-induced sediment resuspension. There are two types of storm response found. In summer, the seasonal stratification limits midshelf sediment resuspension to below the pycnocline even during hurricanes. In contrast, winter storms suspend sediment throughout the full water column. The transition between summer and winter seasons starts with surface cooling that preconditions the shelf for rapid mixing during fall storms. The mixing storm of October 2003 was a classic northeaster. Early in the storm when waves were high, sediment resuspension was limited to below the pycnocline. After the pycnocline eroded through growth of the bottom boundary layer, particles immediately filled the full water column. The spectral ratio of backscatter indicated that the particles were likely similar materials both before and after the stratification was eroded. The backscatter profiles in the bottom boundary layer decay with distance from the bed at rates consistent with theory but with variable slopes. The reduced slope of the backscatter profiles increased after stratification was lost, which is consistent with an increase in vertical transport or turbulent mixing. Wave bottom orbital velocities during this time were decreasing, and the glider vertical velocities showed no enhancement consistent with Langmuir cells. Enhanced mixing was related to the interaction of the surface and bottom boundary layers while the stratification was eroded, and the observed variability in the resuspension during the event was also due to the tide.},

As sea level rises over the long term, the shoreface and inner shelf are eroded as barrier islands migrate landward; large storms like Sandy are thought to be a primary driver of this largely evolutionary process. The “before” data were collected in 2011 by the U.S. Geological Survey as part of a long-term investigation of the Fire Island barrier system. The “after” data were collected in January, 2013, ~two months after the storm. Surprisingly, no widespread erosional event was observed. Rather, the primary impact of Sandy on the shoreface and inner shelf was to force migration of major bedforms (sand ridges and sorted bedforms) 10’s of meters WSW alongshore, decreasing in migration distance with increasing water depth. Although greater in rate, this migratory behavior is no different than observations made over the 15-year span prior to the 2011 survey. Stratigraphic observations of buried, offshore-thinning fluvial channels indicate that long-term erosion of older sediments is focused in water depths ranging from the base of the shoreface (~13–16m) to ~21m on the inner shelf, which is coincident with the range of depth over which sand ridges and sorted bedforms migrated in response to Sandy. We hypothesize that bedform migration regulates erosion over these water depths and controls the formation of a widely observed transgressive ravinement; focusing erosion of older material occurs at the base of the stoss (upcurrent) flank of the bedforms. Secondary storm impacts include the formation of ephemeral hummocky bedforms and the deposition of a mud event layer.}

In this paper, we undertake the first global review of the population and urban settlement patterns in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ), defined here as the contiguous area along the coast that is less than 10 metres above sea level. Overall, this zone covers 2 per cent of the world's land area but contains 10 per cent of the world's population and 13 per cent of the world's urban population. A disproportionate number of the countries with a large share of their population in this zone are small island countries, but most of the countries with large populations in the zone are large countries with heavily populated delta regions. On average, the Least Developed Countries have a higher share of their population living in the zone (14 per cent) than do OECD countries (10 per cent), with even greater disparities in the urban shares (21 per cent compared to 11 per cent). Almost two-thirds of urban settlements with populations greater than 5 million fall, at least partly, in the zone. In some countries (most notably China), urbanization is driving a movement in population towards the coast. Reducing the risk of disasters related to climate change in coastal settlements will require a combination of mitigation, migration and settlement modification. }

abstract = {Wave-dominated and mixed-energy barriers are extremely dynamic landforms, responding to processes operating over a spectrum of time scales, ranging from daily-to-monthly fluctuations related to storm and post-storm conditions, to century-to-millennium-scale evolution driven by relative sea-level change. Two types of storms are of particular relevance: warm-core tropical and cold-core extratropical cyclones. Both are responsible for generating very large waves, highly energetic surf zone dynamics and sediment transport, elevated inshore water levels, and extensive morphological responses. All cyclones are affected by climate change, which governs their frequency, intensity and tracks. Barrier storm response is primarily governed by maximum storm runup and barrier morphology, as conceptualised in Abby Sallenger's Storm Impact Scale model (Sallenger, 2000). This model defines four storm-impact regimes and includes erosive as well as accretionary responses. On the erosion side, the swash regime drives bar and berm flattening; the collision regime is marked by dune scarping and beach lowering; the overwash regime leads to dune scouring and channel incision; and the inundation regime may result in barrier destruction. On the deposition side, storm berms and beach ridges may form and accrete in the swash and collision regimes; localised vertical beach and barrier accretion are associated with the collision and overwash regimes; and washover deposition takes place in the overwash and inundation regimes. Site-specific factors play a key role in moderating the morphological response and include storm characteristics (type, duration and track), longshore sediment supply, upwelling–downwelling currents, coastal setting and inner-shelf topography. The response of a barrier to a tropical or extratropical cyclone can, however, not be considered in isolation and has to be appreciated in a longer temporal context involving morphological preconditioning due to antecedent wave and water-level conditions. Additionally, a simple process-response approach of the cause-and-effect type is inappropriate and a more complex conceptual framework, involving thresholds, feedbacks, resilience and vulnerability, will need to be adopted. A useful way to visualise and conceptualise more complex storm behaviours and the longer-term vulnerability of barriers is the ‘resilience trajectory’, which maps out the changes in barrier geometry (elevation and width) over various time scales, from weeks to years or even longer, and under varying forcing conditions, including changes in storminess and sea-level rise. An increased understanding of barrier response to storms and sequences of storms is required to better quantify long-term barrier response to climate change. High-resolution and comprehensive decadal records of barrier response to storms are a prerequisite to achieve this ambition, linking site-specific coastal settings, hydrodynamic drivers and morphological responses, and allowing the recognition of recovery- and impact-dominated phases. The enhanced insights in barrier response to extreme events must then be incorporated into improved coastal response models to help predict the impacts of future climate change on wave-dominated and mixed-energy barriers around the world.}

The model is based upon the general observation that the shoreline tends to approach an equilibrium position exponentially with time when subjected to constant forcing. The model represents the shoreline response to cross-shore processes only and is extremely efficient, requiring only readily obtainable wave and water-level data as input. Shoreline changes are forced by changes in the local water surface elevation due to a combination of local tide, storm surge and wave-induced setup. The model contains three adjustable parameters, representing a baseline condition from which equilibrium shoreline displacements are calculated, and two rate constants, all of which are evaluated by minimizing the error between model hindcasts and several historical shoreline data sets. Several possible forms for the rate parameters, incorporating local wave and sediment properties, were considered and evaluated. At most sites, the model has proven successful in predicting large-scale shoreline response to local water level and wave forcing. The combination of model accuracy and efficiency, along with the minimal data required to drive the model, make it a potentially useful tool in many coastal engineering applications. As more high-quality shoreline, wave and water-level data sets become available, significant improvements can be made in the determination of the rate parameter governing the time scale of the beach response.}

Understanding what controls cross-shore sediment flux magnitudes is critical for making accurate forecasts of barrier response to increased SLR rates. Here, using an existing morphodynamic model for barrier island evolution, observations are used to constrain model parameters and explore potential variability in future barrier behavior. Using modeled drowning outcomes as a proxy for vulnerability to SLR, 0\%, 28\%, and 100\% of the barrier is vulnerable to SLR rates of 4, 7, and 10 mm/yr, respectively. When only overwash fluxes are increased in the model, drowning vulnerability increases for the same rates of SLR, suggesting that future increases in storminess may increase island vulnerability particularly where sediment resources are limited. Developed sites are more vulnerable to SLR, indicating that anthropogenic changes to overwash fluxes and estuary depths could profoundly affect future barrier response to SLR.},

Management response to the impacts of erosion is somewhat limited by National Park Service philosophy, but some options remain because the negative sediment budget is a product of barriers to sediment transport updrift of the Park. The erosional situation is exacerbated by an exposure of an antecedent backmarsh feature within the Park that is affecting the inshore pattern of incident waves. Recent monitoring data indicate planform conformity to an updrift log-spiral erosional bluff that extends downdrift to a site with beach and dune features. Despite a general net negative sediment budget in the profile, the dune feature is increasing in volume as it shifts inland, fitting models of foredune development. Seasonal monitoring of the topography records that storms cause a stepwise inland displacement of an updrift portion of the Park and a more linear displacement in the downdrift portion. Among the options consistent with management policy responding to the negative sediment budget issue is an opportunity to work within the scale of the small sediment transport cell and backpass sediment toward the updrift margin of the cell.}

ABSTRACT = {Beach nourishment was applied at three fetch-restricted sites along the estuarine margin of Delaware Bay, New Jersey. Evaluation of geomorphological performance of the nourishment project was conducted through seasonal monitoring to track linear features (shoreline, dune crest, peat edge) and to create digital elevation models (DEMs). Comparisons of the DEMs yielded sediment budgets of the updrift, fill area, and downdrift zones as well as the spatial and temporal evolution of the tidal flat, beach, and dune features within the zones. Through four years, Moore’s Beach lost all of the emplaced fill as well as an additional −5446 m3 from the fill area. The shoreline position shifted inland −12.78 m, and the foredune crest shifted inland −9.23 m. The fill area at Pierce’s Point lost all of the fill and an additional −3810 m3. The shoreline and dune crest shifted inland −7.35 m and −1.17 m, respectively. The Reed’s Beach study area benefited from beach fill updrift that more than offset the losses in the fill area, a net gain of 2107 m3. There was a major contrast in volumetric change between the updrift and downdrift portions. Sediment budget calculations established alongshore transport was an important factor in the fetch-restricted estuarine environment driving the variable geomorphological responses in the updrift, fill, and downdrift zones.},

Monitoring of the recovery revealed that the alongshore coastal dune/beach system response (one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional metrics) was strongly related to the 11 groin sectors and that the total volume losses increased downdrift. Hurricane Sandy resulted in a general inland displacement of the dune feature along the entire site, mean of –32 m, and a landward displacement of the shoreline, mean of –3 m. There was a volumetric loss of 81,000 m3; 29,000 m3 of this was from the dune feature. Post-Sandy to Fall 2018, the dune was displaced 2 m seaward and had a volumetric gain of 10,580 m3. Comparison of the dune displacement and sediment budget metric indicated that through the six-year recovery period, the dune feature was accumulating sediment but that it was not shifting seaward to its former position despite updrift beach nourishment totaling ∼3,180,000 m3 in the period 2010–18. The inland displacement and retention of the beach-dune system under a negative sediment budget is consistent with geomorphological theory, indicating a geomorphological resilience to rebuild while shifting inland. Accordingly, the former position of Shore Road along Fort Tilden is deemed unsuitable for reconstruction in place because of increased exposure in the Post-Sandy environment.},

 abstract = {A new scale is proposed that categorizes impacts to natural barrier islands resulting from tropical and extra-tropical storms. The proposed scale is fundamentally different than existing storm-related scales in that the coupling between forcing processes and the geometry of the coast is explicitly included. Four regimes, representing different levels of impact, are denned. Within each regime, patterns and relative magnitudes of net erosion and accretion are argued to be unique. The borders between regimes represent thresholds denning where processes and magnitudes of impacts change dramatically. Impact level 1 is the 'swash' regime describing a storm where runup is confined to the foreshore. The foreshore typically erodes during the storm and recovers following the storm; hence, there is no net change. Impact level 2 is the 'collision' regime describing a storm where the wave runup exceeds the threshold of the base of the foredune ridge. Swash impacts the dune forcing net erosion. Impact level 3 is the 'overwash' regime describing a storm where wave runup overtops the berm or, if present, the foredune ridge. The associated net landward sand transport contributes to net migration of the barrier landward. Impact level 4 is the 'inundation' regime describing a storm where the storm surge is sufficient to completely and continuously submerge the barrier island. Sand undergoes net landward transport over the barrier island; limited evidence suggests the quantities and distance of transport are much greater than what occurs during the 'overwash' regime.},

 abstract = {Beaches in fetch-restricted estuarine settings are often aligned orthogonal to the direction of greatest fetch and they function as systems that have little alongshore transport or exchange. This situation is tested in a portion of the bayside of Sandy Hook, New Jersey, on a 1.4 km stretch of beach. The beach is divided into segments by engineering structures. GPS topographical-surveys were conducted over a span of two years to analyze the adjoining segments to determine their constancy in response among and within segments. The within and among segment comparisons reveal the degree of alongshore versus cross-shore interaction at the bayside beaches and describe those portions of the beach profile that are more related to the maximum fetch directions and those that are least related. Further, the methodology employed offers a procedure to identify the comparative dimensional responses of the beach system to the orthogonal wave approach.},

abstract = {Estimation of erosion volumes for adequate dry beach buffer zones is commonly estimated on the basis of a single extreme event, such as the 1 in 100year storm. However, the cumulative impact of several smaller, closely spaced storms can lead to equal, if not more, dry beach loss, but this is often not quantified. Here we use a calibrated model for dune erosion, XBeach, to hindcast the cumulative erosion impact of a series of historical storms that impacted the Gold Coast, Queensland region in 1967. Over a 6-month period, four named cyclones (Dinah, Barbara, Elaine, and Glenda) and three East Coast Lows caused a cumulative erosion volume greater than the predicted 1 in 100year event. Results presented here show that XBeach was capable of reproducing the measured dry beach erosion volume to within 21% and shoreline retreat to within 10%. The storms were then run in 17 different sequences to determine if sequencing influenced final modeled erosion volumes. It is shown that storm sequencing did not significantly affect the total eroded volumes. However, individual storm volumes were influenced by the antecedent state of the beach (i.e. prior cumulative erosion). Power-law relationships between cumulative energy density (∑E) and eroded volume (∆V) as well as cumulative wave power ((∑P)) and eroded volume (∆V) both explained more than 94% of the modeled dry beach erosion for the 1967 storm sequences. When the relationship was compared with observed and modeled erosion volumes for similar beaches but different storm forcing, the inclusion of pre-storm beach swash slope (βswash) in the parameterization was found to increase the applicability of the power-law relationship over a broader range of conditions.}

abstract = {Nearly 2 years of wave and current observations are used to drive a calibrated bottom boundary layer model to examine sediment transport at the Long-term Ecosystem Observatory (LEO-15) located off of the southern coast of New Jersey. The multiyear record is of sufficient resolution to categorize sediment mobilization characteristics such as storm duration, frequency of occurrence, seasonal trends, and modes of transport at this shallow water sandy site. A total of 51 sediment transport events are identified within the 2 year timeframe. Thirty-two are categorized as winter events, and wintertime sediment transport constitutes 63\% of the total for the 2 year period. In nearly all cases, bed load transport dominates the suspended load. The majority of the bed load transport is onshore due to wave asymmetries that lead to higher orbital velocities during the forward half of the wave cycle. For the remainder of events a bimodal wave spectrum is suspected to reverse the orbital velocity skewness leading to offshore transport. Suspended sediment transport is primarily directed alongshore toward the southwest, consistent with current patterns during northeasters. By including bed load transport, the net sediment transport for the 2 year period is directed primarily onshore and slightly alongshore toward the southwest.},

Four profile sites have been used as a data set to provide an understanding of changes to beach volume, width, and shape. Moruya beach represents a moderately high energy, microtidal environment, which responds in a dramatic way to major storm events such as those experienced in the mid-1970s. This study distinguishes between profile characteristics associated with such a period (erosion-dominated or EDP) compared with periods when accretion dominated (ADP) accompanied by foredune expansion in both height and width.},
